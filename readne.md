This repository serves as a showcase of projects done during my studies
at Brno University of Technology (BUT). This university is well-known for
it's practical orientation and as a result, a lot of projects are made during
the studies to test out theory learned. Projects include graphics, hardware, 
networking, applications implemented in high-level and scripting languages and
much more.

Please take copyrights seriously as not all of this is my work. For some projects
a skeleton of program was provided and only important parts were filled in. Each
file should have a header noting at least the list of authors. A file with authors
other than me may not be used for any purposes until license or permission
is obtained. Files without header can be considered as my work as sometimes
file format prevented adding them or I didn't bother.
